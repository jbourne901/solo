Group -> queue

A skill defines priority of user selection for calls in queue.
Skill has priority over distribution strategy (e.g. round robin).
Distribution strategy is applied to group of agents with the same skill level.

A user can have multiple skills.
Required skill is determined by the variable attached to the call.

Skills are global, they are not queue-specific.
Groups are assigned to queues, but skills are not.
