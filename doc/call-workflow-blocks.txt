Wait for silence
Play message (default is background play)
DTMF capture block - put it in the beginning if workflow.


How to:
- periodic play (every n seconds)
- N attempts
- Recognize dtmf only after certain message is (fully / partially) played. For each message - remember last time when it started playing and set flag after it is played.
- schedule
- mutli-choice



Building blocks:
Play message (background + TTS) - maybe dont need separate block for TTS, we will just lazily write message and cache (lazy vs eager?)
DTMF capture
Choice (also covers IF)
Set variable to expression
